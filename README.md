## What is Dav?

Dav is a terminal-based AI assistant designed specifically for system administrators, DevOps engineers, and power users. Unlike general-purpose AI chatbots, Dav is built with deep understanding of:

- **System Administration**: Linux/macOS system management, service configuration, troubleshooting
- **Cybersecurity**: Log analysis, threat detection, security hardening, vulnerability assessment
- **Network Administration**: Network configuration, monitoring, troubleshooting
- **Command Execution**: Safe, validated command execution with automatic feedback loops

Dav operates directly in your terminal, automatically detecting your operating system, current directory, and system context. It can execute commands (with your approval), analyze logs, troubleshoot issues, and automate repetitive tasks—all through natural language conversation.

### Key Philosophy

Dav follows a **security-first** approach: it analyzes requests, understands context, and asks for confirmation before executing potentially dangerous operations. It's designed to be a helpful assistant, not a blind executor.

  - Anthropic API key ([get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))
  - Google Gemini API key ([get one here](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey))

### Quick Install (Recommended)

**Using pipx** (isolated installation, recommended):

```bash
# Install pipx if needed
sudo apt install pipx  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install pipx      # macOS
sudo dnf install pipx  # Fedora

# Install Dav
pipx install git+https://github.com/poaxy/DAV.git
```

**Using pip** (user installation):

```bash
pip install --user git+https://github.com/poaxy/DAV.git
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"  # Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc for persistence
```

**Using virtual environment** (isolated environment):

```bash
python3 -m venv dav-env
source dav-env/bin/activate
pip install git+https://github.com/poaxy/DAV.git
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
dav --version  # Should show version information
dav            # Should trigger setup wizard
```

---

## Quick Start

### First-Time Setup

After installation, Dav will automatically prompt you to set up on first use:

```bash
dav "how do I check disk usage?"
```

Or run setup manually:

```bash
dav --setup
```

The setup wizard will:
1. Create `~/.dav` directory
2. Prompt for AI backend choice (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini)
3. Ask for your API key
4. Create configuration file with secure permissions

### Manual Configuration

Alternatively, create `~/.dav/.env` manually:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.dav
nano ~/.dav/.env
```

Add your configuration:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
DAV_BACKEND=openai
DAV_DEFAULT_MODEL=o4-mini
```

Set secure permissions:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.dav/.env
```

---

## Usage Guide

### Basic Query (Analysis Mode)

Get explanations and recommendations without executing commands:

```bash
dav "how do I check disk usage?"
dav "what's the difference between systemd and init?"
dav "explain this error: Permission denied"
```

### Execute Commands

Execute commands with confirmation:

```bash
# Single command execution
dav "list processes using port 80" --execute

# Auto-confirm (use with caution)
dav "update system packages" --execute --yes

# Multi-step tasks with automatic feedback loops
dav "check if nginx is running, if not start it" --execute
```

### Interactive Mode

Start a multi-turn conversation:

```bash
dav -i
```

In interactive mode:
- Type queries naturally
- Use `>` prefix to execute shell commands directly
- Use `/cmd` to switch to command mode
- Use `/dav <query>` to ask Dav questions in command mode
- Use `/int` to switch back to interactive mode
- Use `/clear` to clear session history
- Use `/exit` or `exit` to quit

Example session:

```
dav> check disk space
[Dav analyzes and shows disk usage]

dav> find large files in /var/log
[Dav finds and lists large files]

dav> > ls -lh /var/log
[Executes command directly]

dav> /cmd
[Switches to command mode]

> pwd
/home/user

> /dav what's in this directory?
[Dav analyzes current directory]

> /int
[Switches back to interactive mode]

dav> exit
```

### Session Persistence

Maintain context across multiple queries:

```bash
# Start a session
dav --session myproject "what's in the current directory?"

# Continue the same session later
dav --session myproject "analyze that log file we saw earlier"
dav --session myproject "fix the errors we found"
```

### Piped Input

Analyze output from other commands:

```bash
# Analyze log files
tail -n 100 /var/log/syslog | dav "what errors do you see?"

# Analyze command output
ps aux | dav "which processes are using the most memory?"

# Analyze file contents
cat error.log | dav "explain these errors"
```

### Log-Focused Analysis Mode

Analyze logs with explicit log mode (helps Dav treat stdin purely as log content):

```bash
# Analyze application logs with log-focused prompts
cat app.log | dav -log "why is my app crashing?"

# Use default log analysis prompt
cat app.log | dav -log
```

### Script-Based Automation

Generate reusable bash scripts from natural language requests:

```bash
# Create a maintenance script
dav --script "write a script to update system packages and clean cache"

# Create a backup script
dav --script "write a script to back up /home to /backup with compression"
```

For each `--script` call, Dav will:

- Generate a bash script under `~/.dav/scripts/`
- Show you the script contents
- Ask with **Allow/Deny** whether to run it now (optionally as root via `sudo`)

List existing scripts:

```bash
dav --script-list
```

### Vulnerability Scanning & CVE Analysis

Scan your system for known vulnerabilities using NVD-backed CVE data:

```bash
# Full system scan
dav --cve scan

# Scan only core security-critical packages
dav --cve scan-core

# Ask targeted questions after a scan
dav --cve "summarize critical OpenSSL vulnerabilities affecting this system"

# Allow Dav to execute suggested remediation commands (with confirmation)
dav --cve scan --execute
```

### Update Dav

Update to the latest version:

```bash
dav --update
```

This preserves your configuration while updating the package.

### Root Installation (for Automation)

Install Dav for root user (alternative to sudoers configuration):

```bash
dav --install-for-root
```

This allows Dav to run as root for automation tasks without sudoers configuration.

## Security

### Built-in Security Features

1. **Dangerous Command Detection**
   - Blocks destructive commands (`rm -rf /`, `dd if=/dev/zero`, etc.)
   - Requires explicit user request for dangerous operations
   - Extra checks around reboot/shutdown and other system-level operations

2. **Command Validation**
   - Shell injection protection
   - Command parsing and validation before execution
   - Platform-specific command verification

3. **File Security**
   - Secure file permissions on configuration files (600)
   - Permission validation before reading sensitive files
   - Warnings for insecure file permissions

4. **Input Validation**
   - Query length limits to prevent token overflow
   - Input sanitization
   - Prompt injection detection

5. **Confirmation Prompts**
   - Always asks for confirmation before executing commands (unless `--yes` is used)
   - Shows command before execution
   - Clear warnings for potentially dangerous operations

### Security Best Practices

1. **API Keys**: Store API keys securely in `~/.dav/.env` with 600 permissions
2. **Scripts**: Review generated scripts before running them, especially as root
3. **Sudo Usage**: Configure and use `sudo` carefully for automation (use specific commands when possible)
4. **Review Commands**: Always review commands before confirming execution
5. **Session Files**: Session files may contain sensitive information; keep `~/.dav/sessions` secure

### Dangerous Commands (Blocked by Default)

These commands are blocked unless explicitly requested:
- System reboot/shutdown: `reboot`, `shutdown`, `poweroff`, `halt`
- System file deletion: `rm -rf /etc`, `rm -rf /usr`, etc.
- Disk operations: `dd if=/dev/zero`, `mkfs`, `wipefs`
- Bootloader modification: `grub-install` with dangerous flags
- Root password changes: `passwd root`
- Security feature disabling: Turning off firewalls, SELinux, etc.

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found: `dav`

**Solution**: Add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

### Externally-managed-environment error

**Solution**: Use `pipx` (recommended) or `pip install --user`:

```bash
# Install pipx
sudo apt install pipx  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install pipx      # macOS

# Install with pipx
pipx install git+https://github.com/poaxy/DAV.git
```

### Empty .env file or API key not found

**Solution**: Run setup wizard:

```bash
dav --setup
```

Or manually create `~/.dav/.env` with your API key.

### API errors (rate limits, authentication)

**Solution**: 
- Check your API key is correct
- Verify you have credits/quota with your provider
- Configure multiple providers for automatic failover
- Check network connectivity

### Commands not executing

**Solution**:
- Use `--execute` flag for command execution
- Check `DAV_ALLOW_EXECUTE` setting in config
- Review confirmation prompts (commands require approval)
- Check command validation errors

### Session not persisting

**Solution**:
- Check `DAV_SESSION_DIR` in configuration
- Verify directory permissions: `ls -la ~/.dav/sessions`
- Use explicit session ID: `dav --session myid "query"`

### Provider failover not working

**Solution**:
- Ensure multiple API keys are configured
- Check provider priority in configuration
- Review failover logs in terminal output
- Verify API keys are valid
